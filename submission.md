## What it is

A customer-support agent for a Web3 creator studio that turns every resolved ticket into
durable, structured knowledge on Walrus. A fix reached in one conversation is recalled in a
separate session, because the memory lives on the company's Walrus account rather than in a chat
log or a vendor's database. The prompt is the product; the app around it is a thin harness that
runs the model through the MemWal tool loop and streams the memory activity to the UI.

## Checklist

- [x] Full copy-pasteable prompt — [support-agent-prompt.md](support-agent-prompt.md)
- [x] Multi-namespace memory design (`resolved-{area}`, `open-tickets`, `customer-{id}`, `product-intel`) with tier scoping
- [x] Blobs written on Mainnet — ~12–14 raw (8 unique memories) ([evidence/blobs.md](evidence/blobs.md))
- [x] Agent ID + MemWalAccount + agent wallet recorded (table above)
- [x] Behavior calibration — 8-point suite, all passing ([evidence/findings.md](evidence/findings.md))
- [x] Feedback / GitHub issues on MystenLabs/MemWal — [#814](https://github.com/MystenLabs/MemWal/issues/814), [#815](https://github.com/MystenLabs/MemWal/issues/815), [#816](https://github.com/MystenLabs/MemWal/issues/816)
- [x] Demo video recorded — [youtu.be/Ogv5r7-aKMo](https://youtu.be/Ogv5r7-aKMo)
- [x] ≥10 blobs on Mainnet — **~12–14 raw blobs** on Walrus (8 unique memories; the extra are duplicate writes from the relayer's write-timeout bug, [#814](https://github.com/MystenLabs/MemWal/issues/814)). Exact `memwal_restore` total pending the relayer recovering from its 429 / 503 outage.

## Honest note on the relayer

During and after this build the managed relayer was intermittently unavailable (429 rate-limit
and 503 upstream errors). It blocked live recall and further writes at submission time. The
memories already on Walrus are unaffected and verifiable at the links in
[evidence/blobs.md](evidence/blobs.md) — which is the argument for storing them there: the data
outlives the service.
